WordPress-API-Client
====================

An API client library for WordPress. Utilizes the WordPress HTTP API

This client is fully function with regards to GETting resources, but does not POST.

All the code was tossed up here sort of in progress so there is no real documentation to speak of yet.
There is a demo folder with a couple files to give you an idea of how it works, however the files
themselves are part of a different project and were only pulled in as a quick example until a real
demo can be built.
